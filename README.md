**# Cardiac-Failure-Analysis**


Project objective:
To analyze Cardiac failure reasons based on demographic, medical conditions.


Provided insights on:
1. Update the demography table. Add a random age  for each patient that falls within their respective age category. Update the newly added age to be an integer.
2. Calculate patient's year of birth using admission date from the hospitalization_discharge and add to the demography table.
3. Create a User defined function that returns the age in years of any patient as a calculation from year of birth
4. What % of the dataset is male vs female?
5. How many patients in this dataset are farmers?
6. Group the patients by age category and display it as a pie chart
7. Divide BMI into slabs of 5 and show the count of patients within each one, without using case statements.
8. What % of the dataset is over 70 years old
9. What age group was least likely to be readmitted within 28 days
10. Create a procedure to insert a column with a serial number for all rows in demography.
11. what was the average time to readmission among men?
"12. Display NYHA_cardiac_function_classification as Class I: No symptoms of heart failure
 Class II: Symptoms of heart failure with moderate exertion
 Class III: Symptoms of heart failure with minimal exertion  and show the most common type of heart failure for each classification"
13. Identify any columns relating to echocardiography and create a severity score for cardiac function. Add this column to the table
14. What is the average height of women in cms?
15. Using the cardiac severity column from q13, find the correlation between hospital outcomes and cardiac severity
16. Show the no. of patients for everyday in March 2017. Show the date in March along with the days between the previous recorded day in march and the current.
17. Create a view that combines patient demographic details of your choice along with pre-exisiting heart conditions like MI,CHF and PVD
18. Most obese patients belong to which age group and gender. You may make an assumption for what qualifies as obese based on your research

**Conclusion and findings:**
The analysis of cardiac complications reveals that demographic factors like age and gender have an impact on patient outcomes. 
Of the 2008 patients studied, 68% were in Stage II and III of the NYHA classification, with 47% aged 69 to 89 years. 
The 79 to 89 age group had the highest readmission rates within 28 days. 
Additionally, many obese patients are female and in 79 to 89 age group.
